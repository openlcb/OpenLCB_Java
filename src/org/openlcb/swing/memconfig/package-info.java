/**
 * Swing JPanels for doing direct manipulation via the Memory Configuration Protocol
 * <p>
 * This is not intended as a base for production implementations,
 * but rather a convenient example of implementing
 * of OpenLCB protocols.
 * <p>
 * The various "Pane" classes implement independent pieces that can be 
 * arranged as needed. For example, a simple configuration window doesn't
 * need to show the description information pane.
