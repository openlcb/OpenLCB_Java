Swing JPanels for doing direct manipulation via the Memory Configuration Protocol
<p>
This is not intended as a base for production implementations,
but rather a convenient example of implementing
of OpenLCB protocols.
<p>
The various "Pane" classes implement independent pieces that can be 
arranged as needed. For example, a simple configuration window doesn't
need to show the description information pane.
